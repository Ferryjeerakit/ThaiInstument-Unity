This project is created for my university computer programming class</br> 

Here is my project layout:
* Main menu that leads you to the game menu or information tab
* In the information tab you can explore and click on an item to show the information 
* In-game menu you will have to answer the question until the time is out or you choose the wrong answer 3 times. There are many types of questions ex. Picture, sound, video, Text
* after you finish the game it will collect your score in database and show in the scoreboard (you need to login first)</br></br>
